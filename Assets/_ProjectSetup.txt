=== More info ===
Why do this? Two reasons:
- commercial assets can't be committed to public repositories such as github.
- commercial assets often have high quality textures that take a lot of space. Github has a soft limitation of 1GB per repository and 100 MB file size limit.
- Github LFS doesn't work with the SVN API.
