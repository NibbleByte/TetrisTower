2. Migrate the assets to URP if needed. Check each asset's instruction.
3. Move the imported assets to "Assets/ArtExternal" folder. It is svn-ignored so it shouldn't get in the way.

4. Import the following commercial plugins:
	- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/terrain-to-mesh-2021-195349
	- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/r-a-m-2019-river-auto-material-2019-145937
	- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/advanced-vegetation-shader-hdrp-urp-brp-82425

	- (optional) https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/editor-console-pro-11889
	- (optional) https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/rainbow-folders-2-143526
5. Move the imported plugins to "Assets/PluginsExternal" folder. It is svn-ignored so it shouldn't get in the way.

6. Import the following commercial plugins:
	- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/birds/bird-flock-crow-2023-248344
	- https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/animals/birds/bird-flock-seagull-2023-261974
7. Move the imported plugin folders to "Packages". They should be svn-ignored so shouldn't get in the way.
8. Copy the corresponding package definitions from the "PackagesExternal" folder to the plugin folders. This allows the game code to reference those plugins safely.

6. Start the game by running the "HomeScreenScene".
7. Run the "_DevTowerScene" to quickly jump into the game.

=== More info ===
Why do this? Two reasons:
- commercial assets can't be committed to public repositories such as github.
- commercial assets often have high quality textures that take a lot of space. Github has a soft limitation of 1GB per repository and 100 MB file size limit.
- Github LFS doesn't work with the SVN API.
