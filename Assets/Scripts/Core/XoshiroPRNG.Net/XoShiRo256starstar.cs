     * 
     * This is xoshiro256** 1.0, our all-purpose, rock-solid generator. It has
     * excellent (sub-ns) speed, a state (256 bits) that is large enough for
     * any parallel application, and it passes all tests we are aware of.
     * For generating just floating-point numbers, xoshiro256+ is even faster.
     * The state must be seeded so that it is not everywhere zero. If you have
     * a 64-bit seed, we suggest to seed a splitmix64 generator and use its
     * output to fill s.
