Instructions on how to generate the world map textures for the discworld.

Images can be downloaded for free from: https://www.shadedrelief.com/natural3/pages/textures.html

Use Paint.NET + "Polar + Rectangular transformations Plugin" https://forums.getpaint.net/topic/9364-polar-transformations-plugin-ymd100718/

Albedo Texture:
1. Open 16k image.
2. Shrink the image to be square with best quality algorithm.
3. Start "Effects/Distort/Polar Transform".
4. Rect to Polar
5. Leave offset center to (0, 0)
6. Set angle to 20.
7. Boost the quality to 5.
8. Resize canvas to be power of two.
9. Save to jpg with 95% quality and best chroma subsampling.

Height/Normal map and Water mask: repeat the same steps using 16k images (8k have different resolution ratio).

Make blender cone with diameter 400m. That is 50 000 times smaller than earth meridian.
- Vertices - 256,
- Radius 1 - 100m
- Radius 2 - 90m
- Depth - 10m
- Base Fill Type N-Gon
- DON'T SET Z & ROTATION HERE!

- Apply the cone. Move and rotate it so it points up at (0, 0, 0)
- Set the origin to the correct place.

Earth length along the Equator is 40 075 km. Meridian 
A meridian is half of a great circle on Earth's surface. The length of a meridian on a modern ellipsoid model of Earth (WGS 84) has been estimated as 20,003.93 km.
